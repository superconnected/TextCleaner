# Text Cleaner
A tiny utility that strips non-printable characters from text. Includes an HTML/Javascript version, in case your workplace computers, like mine, are locked down by group policy and unable to run programs that are not blessed by the IT department.

#### Boring origin story
A user was having trouble getting some Javascript code to work after copying it from an email and pasting into our CMS system. The issue turned out to be a bunch of invisible characters that were added in the email. Pasting-special as unformatted text in Word was no help, so I threw together this utility to avoid having to retype everything.
